AI Wave Height Model is an advanced deep learning framework that combines the power of U-Net architecture with Earthformer models to achieve accurate predictions of wave 
heights in various marine regions, including the Black Sea, Northwest Pacific, and global oceans.

## Introduction
This model leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to forecast wave heights with high precision. By integrating the U-Net architecture, 
renowned for its excellence in image segmentation tasks, with Earthformer models tailored for spatiotemporal data analysis, 
our framework can effectively capture complex patterns and dependencies in oceanic wave dynamics.
